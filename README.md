# Source Code of 3D Scene Recognition Methods DRF and sMVCNN
This is the source code repository for the methods proposed (DRF) or evaluated (sMVCNN) in the following paper:

"**Semantic Tree-Based 3D Scene Model Recognition**". Juefei Yuan, Tianyang Wang, Shandian Zhe, Yijuan Lu, Bo Li*. Semantic Tree-Based 3D Scene Model Recognition.

## Code
**DRF**: code for our deep random field (DRF) method. DRF shares the recognition framework with MVCNN but incorporates semantic information into the recognition process by integrating an additional semantic tree-based loss into the loss function definition.

**sMVCNN**: code for a baseline method scene based MVCNN (sMVCNN) which is modified from MVCNN (http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/mvcnn/): changed the input
from 3D models to 3D scene models accordingly to run on the benchmark in our experiments. 

## Data
**"27_additional_classes" folder**: the list of 27 additional manually annotated classes' names.\
**"probability_distributions" folder**: all the 30 scene categories' object occurrence probability distributions.

## Dataset
Please download the 3D scene benchmark **Scene_SBR_IBR** *directly* via its dataset webpage. 

**Scene_SBR_IBR**: http://orca.st.usm.edu/~bli/Scene_SBR_IBR/.

## Trained Models
The trained models include: 
1. The Trained sMVCNN model started with pre-trained Places model.
2. The Trained DRF model started with pre-trained Places model
3. The Trained sMVCNN model started with randeomly initialized Places model
4. The Trained DRF model started with randeomly initialized Places model
