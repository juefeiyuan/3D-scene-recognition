# PyTorch code for deep random field (DRF) 
Code is tested on Python 3.6 and PyTorch 1.0.1

**Usage**: \
First, download the Scene_SBR_IBR dataset(same as sMVCNN);

Then, sample the view images and put them into the 'modelnet40_images_new_12x' folder(same as sMVCNN). 

Finally, run the 'train_mvcnn.py' file for training. Compared to sMVCNN, the 'Trainer.py' file incorporates the semantically relatedness relationships between the detected 
scene objectsâ€™ labels and the candidate scene category labels into the training and prediction.
